Copas
(http://www.keplerproject.org/copas)

Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP servers.
It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP stack.

A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests and use
Copas socket functions to send the response.
Copas loops through requests and invokes the corresponding handlers.
For a full implementation of a Copas HTTP server you can refer to Xavante as an example.

Copas is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1

Copas can be downloaded from its LuaForge page.

You can also install Copas using LuaRocks:
luarocks install copas

Dependencies
Copas depends on LuaSocket 2.0 and Coxpcall 1.13.

History
