Overview

Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP servers.
It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP stack.

A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests and use Copas socket
functions to send the response. Copas loops through requests and invokes the corresponding
handlers. For a full implementation of a Copas HTTP server you can refer to Xavante as an example.

Copas is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1

You can also install Copas using LuaRocks:

luarocks install copas

Dependencies

Copas depends only on LuaSocket 2.0.
